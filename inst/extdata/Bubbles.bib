abstract = {Using the daily data for 38 companies during the period of 2009-2013, this article examines the long-run equilibrium between the stock prices of firms dual listed on A-share market in China and H-share market in Hong Kong, and exploits the arbitrage opportunity for investors. We propose a simple self-financing trading strategy which is derived from the short-run disequilibrium price path. Our results demonstrate that cointegration and error-correction mechanism exist between the A-share and the H-share. In addition, our proposed trading strategy actually beats the markets and provides superior performance in terms of Sharp Ratio and value at risk statistics. Further analysis on international asset pricing model demonstrates that our trading strategy yields an average annualized excess return of about 17.6{\%} when adjusted for the systematic risk. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Recentworkoneconometricdetection mechanisms has shownthe effectivenessof recursive procedures in identifying and dating financial bubbles in real time. These procedures are useful as warning alerts in surveillance strategies conducted by central banks and fiscal regulators with real-time data.Use of thesemethods over long historical periods presents amore serious econometric challenge due to the complexity of the nonlinear structure and break mechanisms that are inherent in multiple-bubble phenomena within the same sample period. To meet this challenge, this article develops a new recursive flexible window method that is better suited for practical implementation with long historical time series. The method is a generalized version of the sup augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test of Phillips et al. (“Explosive behavior in the 1990s NASDAQ: When did exuberance escalate asset values?” International Economic Review 52 (2011), 201–26; PWY) and delivers a consistent real-time date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. An empirical application of the methodology is conducted on S{\&}P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach successfully identifies the well-known historical episodes of exuberance and collapses over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and a related cumulative sum (CUSUM) dating procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.},

@article{Evans1991,
abstract = {A number of studies by several economists have argued that dividend and stock price data are not consistent with the market fundamentals hypothesis, in which prices are given by the present discounted values of expected dividends. These results have often been construed as evidence for the existence of bubbles or fads. Related arguments have been made with respect to gold, bonds, and foreign exchange. A major problem with such arguments is that apparent evidence for bubbles can be reinterpreted in terms of market fundamentals that are unobserved by the researcher. Economists have recommended the alternative strategy of testing for rational bubbles by investigating the stationarity properties of asset prices and observable fundamentals. In essence, the argument for equities is that if stock prices are not more explosive than dividends then it can be concluded that rational bubbles are not present, since they would generate an explosive component to stock prices. This article shows that the above battery of tests is in fact unable to detect an important class of rational bubbles. The point is demonstrated by constructing rational bubbles that appear to be stationary when unit-root tests are applied, even though they are explosive in the relevant sense.},

Bubbles are modeled using mildly explosive bubble episodes that are embedded within longer periods where the data evolve as a stochastic trend, thereby capturing normal market behavior as well as exuberance and collapse. Both the PWY and PSY estimates rely on recursive right‐tailed unit root tests (each with a different recursive algorithm) that may be used in real time to locate the origination and collapse dates of bubbles. Under certain explicit conditions, the moving window detector of PSY is shown to be a consistent dating algorithm even in the presence of multiple bubbles. The other algorithms are consistent detectors for bubbles early in the sample and, under stronger conditions, for subsequent bubbles in some cases. These asymptotic results and accompanying simulations guide the practical implementation of the procedures. They indicate that the PSY moving window detector is more reliable than the PWY strategy, sequential application of the PWY procedure, and the CUSUM procedure.},

We identify a recent liberalization policy that generated an unprecedented abrupt reduction in price disparity. The policy, known as Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, partially liberalizes capital flow between both stock exchanges. We find that the announcement of the policy caused the price disparity to immediately reduce by 4.0 to 4.5 percentage points. To estimate the longer-run impact, we use a panel data model and a two-step estimator that accounts for unobserved common factors and potential nonstationarity in outcomes. The effect is somewhat smaller, reducing the price disparity by 1.6 to 2.1 percentage points, or 3.0 to 3.5 percentage points after adjusting for spillovers.},

In both cases we show how the restrictions can be tested through standard chi-squared inference.

abstract = {This paper proposes unit root tests for dynamic heterogeneous panels based on the mean of individual unit root statistics. In particular it proposes a standardized t-bar test statistic based on the (augmented) Dickey-Fuller statistics averaged across the groups. Under a general setting this statistic is shown to converge in probability to a standard normal variate sequentially with T (the time series dimension) → ∞, followed by N (the cross sectional dimension) → ∞. A diagonal convergence result with T and N → ∞ while N/T → k, k being a finite non-negative constant, is also conjectured. In the special case where errors in individual Dickey-Fuller (DF) regressions are serially uncorrelated a modified version of the standardized t-bar statistic is shown to be distributed as standard normal as N → ∞ for a fixed T, so long as T {\textgreater} 5 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and T {\textgreater} 6 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and linear time trends. An exact fixed N and T test is also developed using the simple average of the DF statistics. Monte Carlo results show that if a large enough lag order is selected for the underlying ADF regressions, then the small sample performances of the t-bar test is reasonably satisfactory and generally better than the test proposed by Levin and Lin (Unpublished manuscript, University of California, San Diego, 1993). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We examine the impact of cross-listing on firm-specific information utilizing the unique features of the Chinese capital markets. By separating the trading activity of domestic Chinese investors from that of foreign non-Chinese investors, we are able to isolate each investor group's relative ability to impound firm-specific information into stock prices. We show that the cross-listed H-shares traded by foreign investors incorporate significantly more firm-specific information than their A-share counterparts traded by domestic Chinese investors. We find a similar pattern between H-shares and A-shares even after a 2007 regulatory change that allowed domestic Chinese investors to trade in the H-share market. This finding suggests that while institutional factors (e.g., stricter listing rules, stronger investor protection) can explain some of the benefits of cross-listing, foreign investors' ability to utilize firm-specific information plays a separate and distinct role in generating cross-listing benefits. The level of information improvement due to foreign investors depends on the quality of the cross-listed firm's corporate governance.},

abstract = {We apply bootstrap methodology to unit root tests for dependent panels with N cross-sectional units and T time series observations. More specifically, we let each panel be driven by a general linear process which may be different across cross-sectional units, and approximate it by a finite order autoregressive integrated process of order increasing with T. As we allow the dependency among the innovations generating the individual series, we construct our unit root tests from the estimation of the system of the entire N cross-sectional units. The limit distributions of the tests are derived by passing T to infinity, with N fixed. We then apply bootstrap method to the approximated autoregressions to obtain critical values for the panel unit root tests, and establish the asymptotic validity of such bootstrap panel unit root tests under general conditions. The proposed bootstrap tests are indeed quite general covering a wide class of panel models. They in particular allow for very general dynamic structures which may vary across individual units, and more importantly for the presence of arbitrary cross-sectional dependency. The finite sample performance of the bootstrap tests is examined via simulations, and compared to that of commonly used panel unit root tests. We find that our bootstrap tests perform relatively well, especially when N is small. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article examines the relevance of cash dividend from the theoretical and empirical perspective by taking market liquidity into account. We construct an economic model that demonstrates that the effect of cash dividend on firm valuation depends on the status of market liquidity. The hypotheses derived from our model are strongly supported by data from A- and B-share markets in China. Our results from the dynamic panel regression demonstrate that the price premium of B-share relative to A-share is positively correlated to the level of cash dividend, and this relationship becomes even stronger when the relative liquidity of B-share is in a low status. In addition, this price premium is positively affected by the relative liquidity and firm profitability. The results are robust under alternate liquidity and dividend measures. The subsequent analysis based on the event study approach further reveals a more positive (negative) response to the announcement of cash dividend initiation (omission) in the B-share market. In particular, this positive response on the initiation is negatively correlated with the relative liquidity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {We examine the impact of cross-listing on firm-specific information utilizing the unique features of the Chinese capital markets. By separating the trading activity of domestic Chinese investors from that of foreign non-Chinese investors, we are able to isolate each investor group's relative ability to impound firm-specific information into stock prices. We show that the cross-listed H-shares traded by foreign investors incorporate significantly more firm-specific information than their A-share counterparts traded by domestic Chinese investors. We find a similar pattern between H-shares and A-shares even after a 2007 regulatory change that allowed domestic Chinese investors to trade in the H-share market. This finding suggests that while institutional factors (e.g., stricter listing rules, stronger investor protection) can explain some of the benefits of cross-listing, foreign investors' ability to utilize firm-specific information plays a separate and distinct role in generating cross-listing benefits. The level of information improvement due to foreign investors depends on the quality of the cross-listed firm's corporate governance.},

This test is based on a very restrictive hypothesis which is rarely ever of interest in practice. The Im–Pesaran–Shin (IPS) test relaxes the restrictive assumption of the LL test. This paper argues that although the IPS test has been offered as a generalization of the LL test, it is best viewed as a test for summarizing the evidence from a number of independent tests of the sample hypothesis. This problem has a long statistical history going back to R. A. Fisher. This paper suggests the Fisher test as a panel data unit root test, compares it with the LL and IPS tests, and the Bonferroni bounds test which is valid for correlated tests. Overall, the evidence points to the Fisher test with bootstrap-based critical values as the preferred choice. We also suggest the use of the Fisher test for testing stationarity as the null and also in testing for cointegration in panel data.},

We consider a class of Modified Information Criteria (MIC) with a penalty factor that is sample dependent. It takes into account the fact that the bias in the sum of the autoregressive coefficients is highly dependent on k and adapts to the type of deterministic components present. We use a local asymptotic framework in which the moving-average root is local to -1 to document how the MIC performs better in selecting appropriate values of k. In Monte-Carlo experiments, the MIC is found to yield huge size improvements to the DFGLS and the feasible point optimal PT test developed in Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock (1996). We also extend the M tests developed in Perron and Ng (1996) to allow for GLS detrending of the data.

Weakening informational asymmetries underlie much of the change in the markets' relative pricing. In contrast, sentiment effects strongly underpin the contemporaneous response and error correction adjustments.

It is shown that a deterministic relationship between the truncation lag and the sample size is dominated by data-dependent rules that take sample information into account. In particular, we study data-dependent rules that are not constrained to satisfy the lower bound condition imposed by Said-Dickey. Akaike's information criterion falls into this category. The analytical properties of the truncation lag selected according to a class of information criteria are compared to those based on sequential testing for the significance of coefficients on additional lags. The asymptotic properties of the unit root test under various methods for selecting the truncation lag are analyzed, and simulations are used to show their distinctive behavior in finite samples. Our results favor methods based on sequential tests over those based on information criteria, because the former show less size distortions and have comparable power.

abstract = {The possibility that movements in prices could be due to the self-fulfilling prophecies of market participants has long intrigued observers of free markets. Such self-fulfilling prophecies are often called "bubbles" or "sunspots" to denote their dependence on events that are extraneous to the market. The folklore of such episodes includes the tulip bubble, the South Sea bubble and the Mississippi bubble (all discussed in Peter Garber's article in this issue), and the increase in equity prices during the "Roaring 2O's" followed by the 1929 crash (discussed in Eugene White's article in this joumai). More recently, the rise and crash of stock prices from 1982 to 1987, the appreciation of the dollar on foreign exchange markets that peaked in 1985, and sudden housing price increases in California and Massachusetts have been attributed to speculative bubbles. The idea that bubbles might exist is often traced to John Maynard Keynes's (1936) description of an equity market as an environment in which speculators anticipate "what average opinion expects average opinion to be," rather than focusing on things fundamental to the market.},

The model is restated in innovation form which allows better understanding of the limits on stock price volatility imposed by the model. In particular, this will enable us to see (Section II) that the standard deviation of p is highest when information about dividends is revealed smoothly and that if information is revealed in big lumps occasionally the price series may have higher kurtosis (fatter tails) but will have lower variance. The notion expressed by some that earnings rather than dividend data should be used is discussed in Section III, and a way of assessing the importance of time variation in real discount rates is shown in Section IV. The inequalities are compared with the data in Section V. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Contrary to what has been observed in other markets with a similar segmented structure, the China B shares trade at a discount relative to the A shares. We show that the phenomenon can still be explained by basic economic principles. Specifically, the existence of the H-share and the "red-chip" markets in Hong Kong provide good substitutes for the B-share market. We find that when more H shares and red chips are listed in Hong Kong, the B-share discount becomes larger.

However, there remains some worry about the territory's economic viability and financial stability. Whether Chinese policies and China's remarkable growth momentum could continue to boost Hong Kong's prosperity has become an issue of concern. As the Chinese economic reform proceeds, the ‘China factor' has been generating an increasing influence on the performance of the Hong Kong economy. Unfortunately, there have been very few rigorous quantitative analyses of this rapidly evolving development. To fill the gap, we have constructed a macroeconometric model of Hong Kong which takes into detailed account the linkages of the two economies including trade and capital flows. Estimation of the model incorporates error correction techniques to establish short-run dynamics and long-run equilibria.

In this paper an alternative approach is proposed that utilises model-based minimum sum of squared residuals estimators combined with Bayesian Information Criterion model selection. Conditional on the presence of a bubble, the dating procedures suggested are shown to offer consistent estimation of the start and end dates of a fixed magnitude bubble, and can also be used to distinguish between different types of bubble process, i.e. a bubble that does or does not end in collapse, or a bubble that is ongoing at the end of the sample. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed dating approach out-performs the recursive unit root test methods for dating periods of explosive autoregressive behaviour in finite samples, particularly in terms of accurate identification of a bubble's end point.

We examine several explanations of this phenomenon including: the discretionary use of dividend income by parent companies: differences in parent expenditures; voting rights; currency fluctuations; ex-dividend date timing issues; and tax-induced investor heterogeneity. Only the last hypothesis can explain some, but not all, of the empirical facts. We conjecture that: (a) country-specific sentiment shocks might affect share intensity, (b) investors are rational, but markets are segmented by frictions other than international transactions costs, such as agency problems.},

This research paper implements such tests for explosive rational bubbles in stock prices using a model that assumes a constant discount rate, but that allows unobservable variables to affect market fundamentals and also allows different valuations of expected capital gains and expected dividends. This paper reports empirical tests for the existence of explosive rational bubbles in stock prices. The analysis focuses on a model that defines market fundamentals to be the sum of an unobservable variable and the expected present value of dividends, discounted at a constant rate, and defines a rational bubble to be a self-confirming divergence of stock prices from market fundamentals in response to extraneous variables. The pattern of autocorrelations in the data as well as Dickey-Fuller tests both indicate that stock prices and dividends are nonstationary before differencing, but are stationary in first differences. In contrast, first differences of simulated time-series of rational bubbles exhibit strong signs of nonstationarity.},

In China, the reverse tends to be true. In this paper, we would like to focus on the information content in lagged premiums of Chinese A over B traded shares. The lagged premiums are found to have certain predictive power over the future returns and volatility of both A and B shares, with some interesting patterns. Specifically, an increase in the premium ratio of A shares will be followed by a rise in the return of A shares and a fall in the return of B shares. It is found that both of the investors in Chinese A- and B-share markets reveal positive feedback trading behavior. Moreover, the liquidity and information availability will affect the magnitude of such behavior especially in B-share markets. By using multivariate GARCH model, it is also demonstrated that the unexpected changes in the premium ratio of A-share price over B-share price contribute to the return volatility of both A shares and B shares. These patterns may provide foundations for the development of pricing models for equity shares under market segmentation.},

In Chinese stock markets, a local firm issues two classes of shares: A shares are available only to Chinese citizens, and B shares are available only to foreign citizens. In a setting where domestic investors can invest only in A shares and foreign investors can invest in both B shares and other foreign shares, the price differences between A shares and B shares depend on investors' attitudes toward risk, the correlations between B shares and foreign shares and investors' expectations about future returns. The empirical implications of this theory are supported by evidence in China's stock market. Cross-sectional differences between prices of A shares and B shares are correlated with investors' attitudes toward risk and correla- tions between B shares and foreign shares. Time series variability in the discounts of B shares is highly positively correlated. However, the discounts are not correlated with real interest rates. Regulatory changes may explain part of the variability of B shares' discounts over time.},

abstract = {Recent work on econometric detection mechanisms has shown the effectiveness of recursive procedures in identifying and dating financial bubbles in real time. These procedures are useful as warning alerts in surveillance strategies conducted by central banks and fiscal regulators with real‐time data. Use of these methods over long historical periods presents a more serious econometric challenge due to the complexity of the nonlinear structure and break mechanisms that are inherent in multiple‐bubble phenomena within the same sample period. To meet this challenge, this article develops a new recursive flexible window method that is better suited for practical implementation with long historical time series. The method is a generalized version of the sup augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test of Phillips et al. (“Explosive behavior in the 1990s NASDAQ: When did exuberance escalate asset values?” International Economic Review 52 (2011), 201–26; PWY) and delivers a consistent real‐time date‐stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. An empirical application of the methodology is conducted on S{\&}P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach successfully identifies the well‐known historical episodes of exuberance and collapses over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and a related cumulative sum (CUSUM) dating procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.},

abstract = {A recursive test procedure is suggested that provides a mechanism for testing explosive behavior, date-stamping the origination and collapse of economic exuberance, and providing valid confidence intervals for explosive growth rates. The method involves the recursive implementation of a right-side unit root test and a sup test, both of which are easy to use in practical applications, and some new limit theory for mildly explosive processes. The test procedure is shown to have discriminatory power in detecting periodically collapsing bubbles, thereby overcoming a weakness in earlier applications of unit root tests for economic bubbles. Some asymptotic properties of the Evans (1991) model of periodically collapsing bubbles are analyzed and the paper develops a new model in which bubble duration depends on the strength of the cognitive bias underlying herd behavior in the market. The paper also explores alternative propagating mechanisms for explosive behavior based on economic fundamentals under time varying discount rates. An empirical application to the Nasdaq stock price index in the 1990s provides confirmation of explosiveness and date-stamps the origination of financial exuberance to June 1995, prior to the famous remark in December 1996 by Alan Greenspan about irrational exuberance in financial markets, thereby giving the remark empirical content.},

However, only a few studies investigated how the Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect affected the pricing dynamics of stocks listed in both Shanghai and Hong Kong. Applying linear regression, this study investigates how the Connect affects the H-share discounts of 12 stocks cross-listed in Shanghai and Hong Kong. A new feature of our model is that we add a dummy variable so as to be the first study to examine the effect of the China financial crisis on the A-H premium of the stocks. We find that the A-H premium of all stocks widens significantly after the Connect is launched, implying immatureness or even inefficiency of China's financial market. Furthermore, the result shows that trading activities in the mainland market affects the A-H premium more significantly than trading activities in the Hong Kong market do. This implies that China's financial market plays a dominant role in the Connect.},

abstract = {This paper considers testing against a change in the order of integration of a time series, either from I(0) to I(1) or from I(1) to I(0), at some known or unknown point in the sample. The null hypothesis is that the series is stochastically stationary around a deterministic trend function. For the case of a known change-point the locally best invariant (LBI) tests against the above changes in the order of integration are derived under the assumption of Gaussianity. When the change-point is not known we construct our tests taking functions of the LBI statistics over all possible break-dates. Sub-sample implementations of existing stationarity tests are also considered. We demonstrate by a series of simulation experiments that, for a given direction of change, the LBI-based approach can deliver considerably more powerful tests than both the sub-sample stationarity tests and the ratio-based tests of Kim et al. (J. Econom. 109 (2002) 389) and Busetti and Taylor (Tests of stationarity against a change in persistence, University of Birmingham, Department of Economics, Discussion Paper 01-13, 2001). Moreover, the power losses from an unknown breakpoint do not appear to be large. We also find that standard stationarity tests have good power against both changes from I(0) to I(1) and vice versa, while the ratio-based tests are consistent only against a known direction of change. A further test constructed in terms of the LBI-based statistics for the two possible directions of change is shown to perform generally better than the standard stationarity tests when the direction of change under the alternative is not known. Finally, we apply the tests discussed in the paper to the US inflation rate and find evidence for a change in persistence from I(1) to I(0) behaviour although, significantly, the timing of this change varies according to whether or not a simultaneous change in the level of the series is allowed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The paper proposes a novel inference procedure for long-horizon predictive regression with persistent regressors, allowing the autoregressive roots to lie in a wide vicinity of unity. The invalidity of conventional tests when regressors are persistent has led to a large literature dealing with inference in predictive regressions with local to unity regressors. Magdalinos and Phillips (2009b) recently developed a new framework of extended IV procedures (IVX) that enables robust chi-square testing for a wider class of persistent regressors. We extend this robust procedure to an even wider parameter space in the vicinity of unity and apply the methods to long-horizon predictive regression. Existing methods in this model, which rely on simulated critical values by inverting tests under local to unity conditions, cannot be easily extended beyond the scalar regressor case or to wider autoregressive parametrizations. In contrast, the methods developed here lead to standard chi-square tests, allow for multivariate regressors, and include predictive processes whose roots may lie in a wide vicinity of unity. As such they have many potential applications in predictive regression. In addition to asymptotics under the null hypothesis of no predictability, the paper investigates validity under the alternative, showing how balance in the regression may be achieved through the use of localizing coefficients and developing local asymptotic power properties under such alternatives. These results help to explain some of the empirical difficulties that have been encountered in establishing predictability of stock returns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The simulation design considered is based on simulated data and actual housing data for both U.S. metropolitan areas and international housing markets and thus allows us to draw conclusions for different levels of aggregation. Our findings suggest that aggregation lowers the power of both the SADF and GSADF tests. The effect, however, is much larger for the SADF test. We also provide evidence that tests based on panel data techniques, namely the panel GSADF test recently proposed by Pavlidis et al. (2016), can perform substantially better than univariate tests applied to aggregated series. Furthermore, we also illustrate the date-stamping procedure under the univariate/panel GSADF procedure uncovering novel evidence on the role of interest rates and policy uncertainty as factors explaining episodes of widespread mildly explosive dynamics in housing markets.},

In addition, the construction of Bayesian posterior option price distributions under the two well-known models offers a robust view to the influence of parameter estimation risk on option prices as well as other quantities of interest in finance such as probabilities of default. We derive a VaR-type parameter estimation risk measure for option pricing and we show that parameter estimation risk can bring significant impact to Greeks' hedging activities. Regarding the computation of default probabilities, we find that the impact of parameter estimation risk increases with gearing level, and could alter important risk management decisions.},

This paper introduces a new bootstrap method for small-sample inference in long-horizon regressions. A Monte Carlo study shows that this bootstrap test has much smaller size distortions than conventional long-horizon regression tests. It is also shown that long-horizon regression tests do not have power advantages against economically plausible alternatives. The apparent lack of higher power at long horizons suggests that previous findings of increasing long-horizon predictability are more likely due to size distortions than to power gains. The use of the bootstrap method is illustrated by analyzing whether deviations from monetary fundamentals help predict changes in four major exchange rates. In contrast to earlier studies, the test provides only weak evidence of exchange rate predictability and no evidence of increasing long-horizon predictability. Many of the differences in results can be traced to the implementation of the test.},

This regulatory change triggered a dramatic decline of prevailing B‐share discounts from 80 percent down to 40 percent.Findings – The paper finds that the largest declines in the B‐share discounts around this regulatory event are concentrated in the firms with low government ownership stakes and are unrelated to the firms' risks, relative supplies of shares outstanding and liquidity attributes.Research limitations/implications – This surprising finding challenges the current wisdom about what influences the B‐share discount and particularly the role of political risk in explaining the discount puzzle.Originality/value – The paper offers an alternative interpretation for the B‐share discount puzzle. The findings have important implications for China's future financial liberalization policies.},

abstract = {This paper examines regression tests of whether x forecasts y when the largest autoregressive root of the regressor is unknown. It is shown that previously pro- posed two-step procedures, with first stages that consistently classify x as I(1) or I(O), exhibit large size distortions when regressors have local-to-unit roots, because of asymptotic dependence on a nuisance parameter that cannot be esti- mated consistently. Several alternative procedures, based on Bonferroni and Scheffe methods, are therefore proposed and investigated. For many param- eter values, the power loss from using these conservative tests is small.},

@article{Bailey1994,
abstract = {This paper looks at the brief history of Chinese stock markets since they opened to the world with the listing of ‘B' shares targeted at non-Chinese investors. B share returns exhibit little or no correlation with international stock index returns or returns on China-related stocks traded in Hong Kong and the United States. However, instruments for international risk premiums have some power to forecast B share returns. Discounts at which B shares trade relative to ‘A' shares available to Chinese citizens are correlated across firms and related to similar premiums in other Asian markets. However, they exhibit little association with instruments for international risk premiums. The results suggest that B shares have considerable diversification value but are not entirely segmented from global financial conditions.},

abstract = {We examine Chinese companies that issue both A-shares in mainland China and H-shares in Hong Kong. A-shares are restricted to mainland Chinese investors, while H-shares are available to Hong Kong and international investors. We find that H-shares exhibit significant exposure to Hong Kong market factors and behave more like Hong Kong stocks than mainland Chinese stocks. However, H-shares retain significant exposure to their domestic market and therefore provide foreign investors with diversification opportunities. We find a large time-varying H-share price discount relative to A-shares, and this discount is highly correlated with domestic and foreign market factors and relative market illiquidity. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The focus is on multiple classes of equity that differentiate between foreign and domestic traders, and between domestic individuals and institutions. Significant stock price premia are documented for shares not restricted to a particular investor group. We analyze the theoretical and empirical determinants of premia across firms and over time. In addition to economy-wide factors, segmentation reflects the relative scarcity of unrestricted shares. The results provide additional support for Stulz and Wasserfallen's (1995) hypothesis that firms discriminate between investor groups with different demand elasticities.},

abstract = {This study investigates the impact of the recently introduced Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. Using high frequency data and dynamic forecasting techniques, we find that the new Stock Connect does contribute to the increasing importance of the Chinese mainland stock market and economic activity. A weak and unstable cointegration relationship is found after this event. Additionally, the Stock Connect has also increased the conditional variance of both stock markets. We observe a leading role of the Shanghai stock market to the Hong Kong stock market in terms of both mean and volatility spillover effects after the Stock Connect. Our study indicates that the opening up of stock markets in China could enhance the leading power, influence the risk level and improve the market efficiency of the Chinese mainland stock market, since the volatility spillover effect from Shanghai to Hong Kong is strengthened. Besides, our results have important policy implications, especially on how policy makers should deal with the increased market interconnectedness and for portfolio managers in choosing potential hedging instruments. The success of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect provides valuable operational experience for the forthcoming Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect which could further improve the market efficiency in China.},

@article{Chakravarty1998,
abstract = {In contrast to most other countries, Chinese foreign class B shares trade at an average discount of about 60{\%} to the prices at which domestic A shares trade. We argue that one reason for the large price discount of B shares is because foreign investors have less information on Chinese stocks than domestic investors. We develop a model, incorporating both information asymmetry and market segmentation, and derive a relative pricing equation for A shares and B shares. We show theoretically that an A share index security, tradable by foreigners, increases the liquidity of B shares. Our empirical study of Chinese stocks supports the predictions of our model. Specifically, we show that our model-based proxies for information asymmetry explain a significant portion of the cross-sectional variation of the B share discounts.},

@article{Pavlidis2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York In this paper, we examine changes in the time series properties of three widely used housing market indicators (real house prices, price-to-income ratios, and price-to-rent ratios) for a large set of countries to detect episodes of explosive dynamics. Dating such episodes of exuberance in housing markets provides a timeline as well as empirical content to the narrative connecting housing exuberance to the global 2008 −09 recession. For our empirical analysis, we employ two recursive univariate unit root tests recently developed by Phillips and Yu (International Economic Review 52(1):201–226, 2011) and Phillips et al. (2015). We also propose a novel extension of the test developed by Phillips et al. (2015) to a panel setting in order to exploit the large cross-sectional dimension of our international dataset. Statistically significant periods of exuberance are found in most countries. Moreover, we find strong evidence of the emergence of an unprecedented period of exuberance in the early 2000s that eventually collapsed around 2006 −07, preceding the 2008 −09 global recession. We examine whether macro and financial variables help to predict (in-sample) episodes of exuberance in housing markets. Long-term interest rates, credit growth and global economic conditions are found to be among the best predictors. We conclude that global factors (partly) explain the synchronization of exuberance episodes that we detect in the data in the 2000s.},
